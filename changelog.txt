1.0.1.0 - May 26 2009
-Use conditional logic to test whether a project should be built as a taglib or a standard jar; all implementing build scrips now just need to call 'jar', instead of 'jar-taglib' if the project is a taglib.
-Added 'release' target, to make a .zip containing documentation, javadocs, and the .jar.

1.0.0.0 - April 29 2009
-Initial release.
